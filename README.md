In this project, I will use a data set from the Australian Government's Bureau of Meteorology and the latest data can be gathered from http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/dwo/.
I will use some of the algorithms taught in the IBM DATA SCIENCE course, specifically:

Linear Regression
KNN
Decision Trees
Logistic Regression
SVM
I will evaluate my models using:

Accuracy Score
Jaccard Index
F1-Score
LogLoss
Mean Absolute Error
Mean Squared Error
R2-Score
